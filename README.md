## Notes

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that this project
depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `config.py` lists all the local paths to the necessary data. If this code is 
to run on any other machine, every data source listed on the file should be downloaded
and the paths changed accordingly.

Since the above condition might not be possible. I have included `.html` versions of 
two of the `.md` markdowns, should the evaluator want to see cell outputs.
